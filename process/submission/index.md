## Submission Process

Submitting a project on LanceMatch is quick and easy. You can submit a project for mobile app development, logo design, website redesign, and much more!

## What's the process?

When submitting a project on LanceMatch, you'll be guided through each step of the submission process, including developing a basic project description, category, budget, and scope.

After submission, a member of our team will follow up and help you with anything remaining. We have extensive experience writing requirements and estimating budgets for projects of all sizes so don't worry about getting a bad deal.

## Who can we help?

Almost any creative project can be submitted to LanceMatch. We'll review each project to ensure it's a good fit for our community. If you're serious about your project, we are, too.
