In the day and age of 9 to 5 day-jobs, freelancing sounds like a dream come true. Flexible hours, self-determined workloads, and a dynamic job experience seem enticing—at first.


But freelancing is **hard work**. Demand is never guaranteed and job searching is unending. Clients seldom have the time or money to offer creative scope. Late nights coding/designing for quick turnarounds can be atrocious.

As a freelance designer/developer, both sides of freelancing have become the roller coaster of my life. Freelancing is like sitting on a wood raft in the middle of an ocean storm just for the thrill of it.
What I’ve learned, however, is that the key to staying afloat is to **stay creative**. Working on your side projects can keep your mind fresh, your ideas creative, and your work ethic strong. The advantages of side projects, both for your personal health and portfolio, are limitless:

## Stay creative.

Often freelancing jobs can be restricting; clients have their specifications and we have our own ideas. The common story of the freelancer is being unable to put 80% of client work on your portfolio.

It’s almost impossible to express your own skills when you work within the scope of a client’s goals.

Side projects make it possible to keep your creative flame alive. With your own work, you’re essentially limitless in terms of what you do. Personal endeavors both (a) allow you to show your style and (b) build a portfolio that better represents you.

## Do what you love.

The constant pressure of freelancing is both what we live for and what can end careers. Walking the fine line between stress and pressure defines freelancing, but it’s very easy to burnout. Myself, I can attest that at the lowest points as a freelancer, it’s easy to forget why you love what you do. While we’re passionate about the work we do, freelancing adds additional busywork that can overshadow the fun parts.

Setting time aside every week to simply work for oneself keeps your passion for freelancing alive. Avoid burning out by staying true to what you love to do.

## Showcase yourself.

While freelancers are virtually always busy, our portfolios often fail to capture everything we can and have done. Having to put clients before creativity chokes the scope of freelancer’s portfolios. While it is difficult to find freelance jobs that are worth placing in one’s portfolio, personal projects open up the full range of personal expression.

Being able to make completely independent decisions and have a virtually infinite range of possibilities in terms of what you can do make personal projects limitless. Not only can these projects show your skills, but their success can redefine your career and gain unanticipated exposure for your services. Building a web or mobile app, for instance, that many people like you could use may lead to an influx of interested customers and a significant addition to your portfolio.
