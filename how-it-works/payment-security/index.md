## How does payment work?

After our search for amazing talent is complete, we collect 10% of the project budget. Future payments are not made through us, but with your chosen developer directly.

## What happens if I don't like the the freelancers you guys have picked out?

We offer a money back guarantee for the first 7 days after your deposit is made. If you aren't happy with the freelancers we have picked for you, or you start working with a freelancer and don't like the work he's submitting, we'll refund you 100% of your initial deposit.</p>
