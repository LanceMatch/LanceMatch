## Selection Process

Once you've submitted your project, we'll match you with a handpicked professional from our community in under 48 hours. The goal of LanceMatch is to ensure that each project finds the right professional, every single time. There's no second-best on LanceMatch!

## How do I know I'm getting access to quality talent?

LanceMatch has an experienced team who manually evaluate the quality of each professional before they can gain access to any projects. Our invite-only system ensures that each of our member's portfolios is given an extensive review prior to entry.
