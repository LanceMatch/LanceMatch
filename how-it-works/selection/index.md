## Once I submit a project, how long does the selection process take?

We'll get started right away looking for relevant freelancers. Usually, we're pretty good at getting back to you with potential candidates within the first 48 hours. However, it could take us a little longer depending on the specific requirements of your project.

## What if I do not like the candidates you find?

See [here](/how-it-works/payment-security/).
