## Payment

We're committed to building a trusted, collaborative marketplace. We want you to have a wonderful experience. Because nothing is more important to us than ensuring your project runs smoothly, from start to finish.

## Why do we charge a service fee?

LanceMatch charges a 15% service fee for each project to cover recruiting efforts, the cost of running the site, and allows us to offer support before, during, and after your project.
